							<h1>About me</h1>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><strong>Hello world!</strong> <br>
							I am Gerald Auinger, I am 36 years old, I live in Austria currently and I am on my way to stay in the Netherlands next year.<br></p><p>
							
							My professional journey started two decades ago when I was around 15.</br> I always had an affinity for the logical and technical aspects of life and i have an insatiable curiousity.</br>
							I started my first education as a Mechatronics technician at the age of 15, which would last for 3,5 years at a huge steel manufacturing company in Austria. This opportunity provided me with my first income and a solid education.</br>
							</p><p>While I was still very young, around 7 years of age, I got my first Atari ST and my first x86 machine at the age of 10. I did what every curious person would have done, I broke them several times to learn and understand everything. 
							I installed win 95SE probably once a week back then and dabbled in early graphics desktop linux versions or tried to wrap my head around the Atari disk loading system. To summarize, before my first education I had already built the foundation for my second professional life.							</p>
							<p>I finished my education with flying colours 3,5 years after I started it and was continuously educating myself in the IT field at the same time. After a one year break to serve the red cross i made some courses in software engineering at a local university but didn't go for a bachelor in the end.</p>
							<p> From this point on I was either working as a system administrator or a mechatronics technician until now. <br>In the IT field I was handling databases, virtual machines, hardware firewalls, switches, or hardware rack installations. <br>As a service technician I was flying around the globe installing fully automated systems of many kinds or doing maintenance work as a shift worker.
							<br>I liked to switch my employments often, and as a quick learner i could afford doing so as I was fully functional in any field pretty quickly.
							
							</p><p>I always felt like i was missing something, i couldn't quite point out what it was but i kept looking over the years.<br> In my spare time i tried PLC programming, low level microcontroller programming, reverse engineering of firmware and PCBs, PCB design, i built a CNC from scratch, i built a hexapod robot some 18 years ago and many more. I always found some project that sparked my curiousity.</br>
							</p><p>I think you get the picture by now, i am curious, i like to analyse things, find the core essence behind it. Until just recenently i didn't realize that i was looking in the wrong direction.<br>
							Some month ago i started to self assess and analyze my personality. I used different tools and tests but the most helpful thing was realizing what my core traits are and how to use them.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
								Compassion
								</li>
								<li>
								Curiosity
								</li>
								<li>
								Learning
								</li>
								<li>
								Intelligence
								</li>
								<li>
								Imagination
								</li>
								<li>
								Individuality
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
							After understanding these traits i made a second list with the most important interests.
														<ul>
								<li>
								Problem Solving
								</li>
								<li>
								Solution Finding
								</li>
								<li>
								Software Tools
								</li>
								<li>
								Self Development
								</li>
								<li>
								Science
								</li>
								<li>
								Technology
								</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
							After some weeks of making manual and digital mindmaps of all sorts, i was finally greeted by a manageable list of professional endevaours that would fully tap into my potential.</br>
							Antropology, Library Science, Economist, Data Science, Data Analyst and a few others were on the list and after looking at my options i made the decision to go for the field of "Data Analysis".
							I would need to start almost from scratch while working ungodly shift hours. I started to find the certificates, the knowledge and tools i would need to get into the field.
							I made a plan how to make all of this work and since September 2021 i follow my daily routine to learn all the beautiful concepts and tools needed to get the foot in the door. 
							</p> 
							Don't hesitate to leave me a message!
